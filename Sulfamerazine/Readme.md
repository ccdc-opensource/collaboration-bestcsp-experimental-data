# Property Data for Sulfamerazine

The csv files in this folder will be used to generate the benchmark dataset in the normal fashion. The Supplementary_data folder and its contents are used as supporting info for the publication
"BEST-CSP benchmark study of polymorphs I and II of sulfamerazine and the perils of polytype polymorphs" to aid peer review and will not actually be used for the BEST-CSP benchmark.
